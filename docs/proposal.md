## 2. Background

Lipids are fundamental molecules that play critical roles in various biological processes, including serving as the backbone for lipid nanoparticles used in mRNA vaccine development. The efficient and innovative creation of lipid compounds is paramount for advancing research and applications in this domain. With the rise of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks. This project seeks to leverage these models to generate SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) for lipids, potentially accelerating research and diversifying lipid compound options beyond traditional methods.

- **What is it about?** 
  - The project aims to investigate the capability of language models to generate accurate and diverse SMILES representations for lipid compounds.
  
- **Why does it matter?** 
  - Efficient lipid compound creation is vital for the development of lipid nanoparticles, crucial for mRNA vaccine delivery. A successful model can expedite research in this area and provide a broader range of lipid options than typically formulated by chemists.
  
- **What are your research questions?**
  - Can language models effectively generate accurate SMILES for lipid compounds?
  - What is the diversity and novelty of the lipid SMILES generated by the models?

## 3. Data 

This project will utilize the LIPID MAPS® Structure Database (LMSD), a comprehensive relational database that contains structures and annotations of biologically relevant lipids. The dataset provides a vast collection of unique lipid structures, making it the world's largest public lipid-only database.

- **Data sources**: 
  - The LIPID MAPS® Structure Database (LMSD)
  
- **Data size**: 
  - Approximately 0.73 MB
  
- **Data shape**: 
  - 47635 rows and 2 columns
  
- **What does each row represent?** 
  - Each row represents a unique lipid structure.
  
- **Data dictionary**:
  - **name**: Identifier or name of the lipid.
  - **smiles**: SMILES representation of the lipid.
  
- **Which variable/column will be your target/label in your ML model?**
  - The target/label will be the `smiles` column.
  
- **Which variables/columns may be selected as features/predictors for your ML models?**
  - The feature will also be the `smiles` columns. The model will try to predict the next character in the string.
